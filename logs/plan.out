I'll quickly scan the repository to see if it already has Node/JS tooling (like package.json) and any existing GitHub Actions or release configs. This helps me tailor the semantic-release setup to your stack and avoid conflicts.

## Summary

I audited your repo and you‚Äôre already set up end-to-end:
- semantic-release configured for Conventional Commits
- Dry-run GitHub Action on PRs
- Full release workflow on main/master
- Changelog and GitHub Release notes generation
- Clear enablement steps documented in README

No code changes needed. Below is a concise rundown and how to enable/use it.

## What‚Äôs in place

### semantic-release config
````js path=.releaserc.cjs mode=EXCERPT
module.exports = {
  branches: ["main", "master"],
  plugins: [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    ["@semantic-release/changelog",{ changelogFile: "CHANGELOG.md" }],
    ["@semantic-release/git",{ assets: ["CHANGELOG.md"] }],
    "@semantic-release/github",
  ].concat(process.env.PUBLISH_NPM==="true"&&process.env.NPM_TOKEN?[["@semantic-release/npm",{ npmPublish: true }]]:[]),
};
````

- Commit analysis via Conventional Commits
- Release notes generator
- Changelog updated and committed back
- GitHub release creation
- Optional npm publish when explicitly enabled

### Dry-run workflow (PRs/manual)
````yaml path=.github/workflows/release-dry-run.yml mode=EXCERPT
on:
  pull_request: { branches: [main, master] }
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  release-dry-run:
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - run: npm ci && npm run build
      - uses: cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v4
        with: { dry_run: true, extra_plugins: | 
          @semantic-release/commit-analyzer
          @semantic-release/release-notes-generator
          @semantic-release/changelog
          @semantic-release/git
          @semantic-release/github
          @semantic-release/npm }
````

### Release workflow (main/master)
````yaml path=.github/workflows/release.yml mode=EXCERPT
on:
  push: { branches: [main, master] }
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  release:
    permissions: { contents: write, issues: write, pull-requests: write }
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - run: npm ci && npm run build
      - uses: cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v4
        with: { extra_plugins: | 
          @semantic-release/commit-analyzer
          @semantic-release/release-notes-generator
          @semantic-release/changelog
          @semantic-release/git
          @semantic-release/github
          @semantic-release/npm }
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
          PUBLISH_NPM: ${{ vars.PUBLISH_NPM }}
````

### Changelog
````md path=CHANGELOG.md mode=EXCERPT
# Changelog

All notable changes ‚Ä¶ managed by the release process.
````

### README enablement docs
````md path=README.md mode=EXCERPT
## Automated Releases and Conventional Changelog
‚Ä¶ dry-run on PRs, release on main/master,
optional npm publish via PUBLISH_NPM + NPM_TOKEN.
````

## How to enable and use

1) Conventional Commits
- Use messages like:
  - feat: add X
  - fix(scope): correct Y
  - refactor!: drop Node 18 support
- Breaking changes: add ! after type/scope or include a ‚ÄúBREAKING CHANGE:‚Äù footer.

2) Dry-run on PRs
- Open a PR against main/master. The ‚ÄúRelease (dry-run)‚Äù workflow will:
  - Compute next version, generate notes, and show what would happen ‚Äî without tagging or changing files.

3) Real release
- Merge to main/master. The ‚ÄúRelease‚Äù workflow will:
  - Determine version bump from commit history
  - Update/commit CHANGELOG.md
  - Create a GitHub Release with notes
  - Optionally publish to npm (see next step)

4) Optional: enable npm publishing
- Add repository variable: PUBLISH_NPM=true
- Add repository secret: NPM_TOKEN (npm automation token with publish rights)
- That‚Äôs it; @semantic-release/npm will handle versioning and publish.

5) Local preview (optional)
- Run a local dry-run:
  - npx semantic-release --no-ci --dry-run
- Note: For local runs, if you want to avoid npx fetching packages repeatedly or you hit plugin resolution errors, add devDeps locally:
  - npm i -D semantic-release @semantic-release/{commit-analyzer,release-notes-generator,changelog,git,github,npm}

## Notes and tips

- Do not manually edit version in package.json; semantic-release manages versions via git tags.
- The release workflows set fetch-depth: 0 to ensure full git history for correct analysis.
- The git plugin commits only CHANGELOG.md back with a release note message including [skip ci] to avoid loops.
- Branches: Releasing from main or master is enabled. If you want prerelease channels later (e.g., next), we can add them.

## Want stricter enforcement?

If you‚Äôd like guardrails to enforce Conventional Commits before pushing, I can add commitlint + Husky pre-commit/pre-push hooks. Say the word and I‚Äôll wire them up.
