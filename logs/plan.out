I'll first check whether this repo contains one or more Node projects by locating package.json files and confirming npm is available. Then I'll run npm audit in each project to gather vulnerabilities. Given this is a multi-step change across potentially multiple files, I'll open a small tasklist to track progress after the first command.

## Task receipt and current status

You asked me to run npm audit, classify vulnerabilities, propose safe upgrades (avoiding breaking changes), and provide exact unified diffs for package.json/lock updates plus a signed commit message, with a rollback plan.

- Environment check: Node and npm are not available on this runner, which blocks running npm audit and generating lockfile diffs.
- Project discovery: Found one Node project at repo root (./package.json).

## Tasklist

- IN_PROGRESS ‚Üí DONE: Verify audit prerequisites (Node/npm presence and locate package.json)
  - Result: package.json found at repo root; Node/npm are missing locally, so I cannot run audit yet.

I will add the next task after you unblock Node/npm per below.

## What I need from you

Please confirm the following so I can proceed end-to-end:

1) May I install Node.js LTS and npm locally in this workspace (no sudo), then run npm commands?
   - Default: Node 22.x LTS via nvm or Volta (no system-wide changes).
   - If you prefer a specific version/manager, let me know.

2) Which package manager do you want to use?
   - Default: npm (since package.json is present; I‚Äôll use npm ci / audit / pkg set).
   - If you use pnpm or yarn instead, tell me and I‚Äôll switch.

3) Do you want me to create a working branch before making changes?
   - Suggested: security/npm-audit-fixes

4) For the ‚ÄúSigned-off-by‚Äù line, please provide your name and email (or confirm I should leave placeholders).

If you already have Node/npm on your machine and prefer to run the audit yourself and share the JSON, I can work from that output too.

## Plan once approved

- Install Node LTS (per your preference).
- Verify and sync deps:
  - If lockfile exists: npm ci
  - If no lockfile: npm install --package-lock-only (no package installs), then npm ci
- Run audits:
  - npm audit --json > audit.json
  - npm audit (human readable)
  - npm outdated (to see safe patch/minor ranges)
- Classify vulnerabilities:
  - By severity (low/med/high/critical)
  - Direct vs transitive
  - Known safe remediations (patch/minor upgrades; transitive via npm ‚Äúoverrides‚Äù without forcing majors)
- Apply safe remediations (no breaking changes):
  - Attempt npm audit fix (without --force)
  - For remaining transitives, prefer targeted overrides via npm pkg set overrides."pkg"="version" (avoids editing files by hand; respects policy)
  - For direct deps, if needed, bump only within same major (patch/minor), using npm install <dep>@^currentMajor.minor.patch
- Re-run audits to confirm resolution:
  - npm audit --json > audit.after.json
- Produce exact diffs (unified, zero-context) for files changed:
  - git diff -U0 -- package.json package-lock.json
- Provide a signed commit message you can use (with Signed-off-by line).

I will not commit or push unless you explicitly ask me to.

## What the deliverables will look like

- Vulnerability summary:
  - Counts by severity
  - Top issues (package@version, advisory, path, fix strategy)
  - A table of actions taken (safe updates and overrides)
- Exact unified diffs:
  - I‚Äôll return unified diffs for package.json and package-lock.json
- Signed commit message:
  - Conventional, mentioning audit results and actions, including Signed-off-by

Example commit message template (will be filled with your actual results):
````text path=.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG mode=EXCERPT
chore(security): npm audit fixes (no breaking changes); add targeted overrides

- Ran `npm audit` and classified vulnerabilities
- Applied `npm audit fix` (no --force)
- Added targeted npm `overrides` for remaining transitive vulnerabilities
- Upgraded direct deps with patch/minor updates only (no majors)
- Re-ran `npm audit` to confirm resolution

See audit.before.json and audit.after.json for details.

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>

## Rollback plan

- If changes aren‚Äôt committed:
  - git restore --source=HEAD -- package.json package-lock.json (or git checkout -- the files if not using restore)
  - Or git reset --hard (if you created a branch)
- If changes are committed:
  - git revert <commit-sha> (preferred, preserves history)
  - Or git reset --hard <previous-sha> (if you want to discard)
- If overrides were added:
  - Remove the overrides via npm pkg delete overrides and run npm ci
- If lockfile integrity issues arise:
  - Delete node_modules and package-lock.json, then npm ci (or npm install --package-lock-only + npm ci)

## If you prefer to unblock me yourself

- Install Node LTS and npm.
- From repo root:
  - npm ci
  - npm audit --json > audit.json
  - Share audit.json here; I‚Äôll classify and propose safe changes and exact diffs, then prepare the signed commit message.

Please confirm the install/branch/signoff details, and I‚Äôll proceed.
