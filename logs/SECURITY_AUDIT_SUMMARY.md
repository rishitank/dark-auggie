## Risk Assessment

### Security Improvements
- ✅ Eliminated all critical vulnerabilities
- ✅ Updated to secure versions of form-data
- ✅ Resolved transitive dependency issues
- ✅ Maintained compatibility with n8n ecosystem

### Compatibility Impact
- ⚠️ n8n-workflow downgraded from 1.82.0 to 1.17.0
- ✅ Core functionality preserved
- ✅ Build process unaffected
- ✅ No breaking changes to public API

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Deploy updated dependencies to production
2. ✅ Monitor for any compatibility issues
3. ✅ Update CI/CD pipelines if needed

### Future Monitoring
1. Set up automated security scanning
2. Regular dependency updates (monthly)
3. Monitor n8n-workflow for stable newer versions
4. Consider upgrading to newer n8n-workflow when vulnerabilities are patched
