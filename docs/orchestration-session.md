## Umbrella Branch
- Name: feature/auggie-orchestration-v2
- Commit history corrected and force‑pushed:
  - 0d21e79 chore(eslint): switch to flat config and fix warnings; update scripts and node code accordingly
  - 5cd96eb ci(review): add Augment Code review GH Action; chore(eslint): remove legacy configs; standardize on flat eslint.config.js

## Lanes (worktrees)
- ai-changelog
- ci-fixes
- ci-tests
- examples-extended
- node-upgrades
- orchestrator-mcp
- release-automation
- scripts-ts-migration
- security-audit
- security-reconcile
- svg-epic
- tooling-setup
- icon-glassmorphism (new lane/branch: feature/auggie-orchestration-icon-glassmorphism)

Each lane lives under:
- /Users/rishitank/github/dark-auggie-worktrees/<lane>
- Logs per lane: <worktree>/logs/patch.out and <worktree>/logs/patch.err

## What we attempted and learned

1) vt auggie per lane (initial approach)
- Goal: run vt auggie via zsh -lic per lane to avoid nested VT.
- Result: vt aborted with “Already inside a VibeTunnel session … Recursive VibeTunnel sessions are not supported.” Even zsh -lic inherited VT env.
- Takeaway: Nested VibeTunnels are not supported. Must avoid parent VT context or scrub env fully.

2) vt with env scrub
- Tried env -i and zsh -lic with vt to remove VT context.
- In this session, nested VT was still detected; safer to avoid vt and use plain auggie.

3) Plain auggie per lane (current approach)
- We launched plain auggie (no vt) per lane in a clean environment (env -i) using minimal PATH and AUGMENT_SESSION_AUTH.
- Verified processes are running for multiple lanes.
- patch.out files are being written; at time of last check, diffs had not yet been emitted (agents still analyzing/planning).

## Current Status (at last checkpoint)
- Running: plain auggie processes observed for several lanes (node /opt/homebrew/bin/auggie … --workspace-root /Users/rishitank/github/dark-auggie-worktrees/<lane>).
- Diffs: none yet; waiting for “diff --git …” + a single “COMMIT: …” line, or “NO-CHANGES”.
- Umbrella: unchanged since force‑push after commit history fix.

## Commands & Snippets (for resumption)

### Check running processes
- ps aux | grep -v grep | grep -E "auggie --print .* --workspace-root /Users/rishitank/github/dark-auggie-worktrees/"

### Tail/Head lane logs
- head -n 60 /Users/rishitank/github/dark-auggie-worktrees/<lane>/logs/patch.out
- tail -n 60 /Users/rishitank/github/dark-auggie-worktrees/<lane>/logs/patch.err

### Launch plain auggie for all lanes (no vt, clean env)
- Use a non‑VT terminal for best reliability.
- Minimal, robust launcher (flattens instruction to one line):

env -i HOME="$HOME" PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin" \
  AUGMENT_SESSION_AUTH="$(cat "$HOME/.augment/session.json" 2>/dev/null)" \
  /bin/bash -lc \
  "auggie --print \"$(tr '\n' ' ' < /Users/rishitank/github/dark-auggie-worktrees/<lane>/logs/instruction.txt)\" \
   --workspace-root \"/Users/rishitank/github/dark-auggie-worktrees/<lane>\" \
   --rules \"$HOME/.augment/rules/sub-agent-orchestration.md\" \
   --compact --model gpt5"

(Repeat for each lane; or wrap in a small bash loop.)

### Apply and verify per lane (when diffs + COMMIT line present)
1. Extract diffs & commit message from patch.out:
   - Diff starts at first line matching: diff --git
   - Commit line: COMMIT: <message>
2. Apply in that lane worktree:
   - git apply --whitespace=nowarn --index /path/to/extracted.diff
3. Verify build/tests (if Node project):
   - npm ci && npm run build
   - If tests exist: npm run test:ci
4. Commit using exact emitted message:
   - git commit -m "<message>"
5. Save the lane’s commit SHA to logs/last_commit_sha.txt

### Consolidate into umbrella
- cd /Users/rishitank/github/dark-auggie
- git checkout feature/auggie-orchestration-v2
- git cherry-pick <lane_commit_sha>
- npm ci && npm run build (quick verification)
- Repeat for each lane commit

### Push umbrella (only when approved)
- git push (note: earlier we force‑pushed after history rewrite)

## Known Pitfalls & Remedies

- Nested VibeTunnel
  - Symptom: “Already inside a VibeTunnel session … Recursive VibeTunnel sessions are not supported.”
  - Remedy: do not run vt inside VT; either run from a normal terminal or use plain auggie (no vt) with env -i.

- Shell quoting in batch launchers
  - Symptom: nohup background launches fail silently; logs not updated.
  - Remedy: flatten instructions to a single line; avoid complex inline quoting; prefer env -i and explicit paths.

- Long‑running auggie planning
  - Expect 5–15 min for first diffs, 20–40 min for most lanes. Keep monitoring patch.out.

## Next Actions (to reach “perfect”)

1) Monitor all lanes for completion signal:
   - Either “NO-CHANGES” or “diff --git …” + “COMMIT: …”.

2) For lanes with diffs:
   - Apply diffs, verify builds/tests, commit with exact message.
   - Cherry‑pick each lane commit into feature/auggie-orchestration-v2.

3) Umbrella verification:
   - npm ci && npm run build
   - Optional: run tests if present

4) Report and push (on approval):
   - Summarize merged lanes and residual NO‑CHANGES lanes
   - Push umbrella branch when approved

## Notes
- This log captures the orchestration state so we can resume later.
- When resuming, prefer a non‑VT terminal for orchestration commands (or use plain auggie with env -i) to avoid nested VT.
